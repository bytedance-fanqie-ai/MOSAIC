## ðŸ”¥ News
- [08/20/2025] ðŸ”¥ The [project page](https://bytedance-fanqie-ai.github.io/MOSAIC/) of MOSAIC is created.

## ðŸ“– Introduction
<p align="center">

</p>
We introduce <b>FocusDPO</b>, a post-training framework that adaptively identifies focus regions based on dynamic semantic correspondence and supervision image complexity. FocusDPO demonstrates capabilities in single-subject and multi-subject driven generation tasks.

FocusDPO introduce <b>spatially-aware optimization framework</b> (left) that adaptively focuses on critical regions through dynamic semantic guidance, leveraging (a) Structure-Preserving Attention Field, which establishes robust correspondence mappings between generated and reference subjects, and (b) Detail-Preserving Complexity Estimator, which provides the semantic complexity of images.
